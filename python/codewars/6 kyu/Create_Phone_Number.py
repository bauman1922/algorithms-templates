"""
Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9),
 that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.

Example
create_phone_number([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) # => returns 
"(123) 456-7890"
The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge.

Don't forget the space after the closing parentheses!
